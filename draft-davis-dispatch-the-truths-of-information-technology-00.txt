                  The Truths of Information Technology
      draft-davis-dispatch-the-truths-of-information-technology-00

Abstract

   The internet and information technology landscape has changed in many
   ways since The Twelve Networking Truths was original published via
   [RFC1925] over twenty six years ago.  As a result this document
   attempts to extend the truths of information technology into the
   twenty-first century.  This memo does not specify a standard, except
   in the sense that all standards MUST implicitly follow the
   fundamental truths.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

1.  Introduction

   This Request for Comments (RFC) provides information about the
   fundamental truths underlying all information technology sectors.
   These truths apply to all information technology sectors in general,
   and are not limited to networking, TCP/IP, the Internet, or any other
   subset of the networking community.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Fundamental Truths

   0.
      With networking, much like programming, numbering SHOULD always
      start with zero.

   1.
      It Has To Work.

   2.
      No matter how hard you push and no matter what the priority,you
      can't increase the speed of light.  You can, however, slow it
      down.

   2a.
      No matter how hard you try, you can't make a baby in much less
      than 9 months.  Trying to speed this up *might* make it slower,
      but it won't make it happen any quicker.

   3.
      With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine.  However, this is not
      necessarily a good idea.  It is hard to be sure where they are
      going to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them as
      they fly overhead.

   4.
      Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor understood
      unless experienced firsthand.  Just as some things in networking
      can never be fully understood by someone who neither builds
      commercial networking equipment nor runs an operational network.

   5.
      It is always possible to agglutinate multiple separate problems
      into a single complex interdependent solution.  In most cases this
      is a bad idea.

   6.
      It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving the
      problem to a different part of the overall network architecture)
      than it is to solve it.

   6a.
      It is always possible to add another level of indirection.

   7.
      It is always something.

   7a.
      Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two (you can't have all three).

   8.
      It is more complicated than you think.

   9.
      For all resources, whatever it is, you need more.

   9a.
      Every information technology problem always takes longer to solve
      than it seems like it should.

   10.
      One size never fits all.

   11.
      Every old idea will be proposed again with a different name and a
      different presentation, regardless of whether it works.  See 6a.

   12.
      In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there is
      nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

   13.
      The network is at fault until proven innocent.  (Helpdesk, end
      users, customers, developers perspective)

   14.
      The Firewall is at fault until proven innocent.  (Network
      Engineers perspective)

   15.
      Everything else is at fault.  (Firewall Engineers perspective)

   16.
      Automation is encouraged and oftentimes recommended. (even at
      times when it shouldn't be.)

   17.
      Never make a change unless you know the impact or ramifications of
      said change.

   18.
      Never test in production.

   19.
      Layer 8 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is People.
      (End Users, customers, developers and network engineers)

   20.
      Layer 9 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is
      company/external regulations, rules, and restrictions

   21.
      Layer 10 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is money,
      budget, and funds

   22.
      Reserved for Catch-22s.

   23.
      If it can break, it will break, unexpectedly, on a weekend/
      holiday.

   24.
      Fail-over and high availability are not suggestions.  Remember to
      test regularly!

   25.
      Change or version control are not a suggestion.

   26.
      You will get no praise when everything is working.  Expect to only
      be needed when things break

   27.
      Cloud simply means somebody else's data center/network.

   28.
      When things don't work, escalate harder.

   29.
      Never assume any software is free of bugs/defects.

   30.
      IPv6 should replace IPv4 any day now.

   31.
      Friday after 5pm local time until Sunday midnight local time are
      perfect change window times.

   32.
      There can always be more people on the conference call.

   33.
      TIAAA (There Is Always Another Acronym)

   34.
      There is no such thing as a random issue.  There MAY be variables
      that make an issue intermittent but it is never truly random.

   35.
      Trust not the actions or analysis of anybody.  "Trust but verify"
      should be the approach to any situation.

   36.
      The packets don't lie.

   37.
      Wireless might as well be magic.

   38.
      Nothing is every truly 100% secure.

   39.
      Everybody's title is made up.

   40.
      One of the hardest parts of any IT professional's day is the
      process of copying a file from a client to a server.  See 14.

   41.
      Documentation, while REQUIRED, is never complete or up-to-date.

   42.
      A minimum of two data points should be collected in order to
      properly point the finger.

   43.
      It is very likely somebody has always thought of it before you.

   44.
      Fear of the unknown oftentimes supersedes common sense.

   45.
      Your microphone behaves much like Schrodinger's cat.  That is, it
      is always in a state of being muted or unmuted until observed; at
      which point it is usually in the wrong state.

   46.
      Sometimes a device needs a reload and there SHOULD be no further
      justification beyond that fact required.

   47.
      The best engineers know how to properly discern the false debug
      errors from the real debug errors.

   48.
      Bourbon or Scotch are the drinks of choice among IT professionals.
      Others SHALL be allowed.

   49.
      Experimental

   50.
      Reserved for Future Use (but will likely never be used.)

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA SHOULD consider these truths valid.

5.  Security Considerations

   This RFC raises no security issues.  However, security protocols are
   subject to the fundamental networking truths.

   The informative references have been deleted in order to protect the
   guilty and avoid enriching the lawyers.

   The authors of this document are [RFC2323] compliant.

6.  Acknowledgements

   The truths described in this memo result from extensive study over an
   extended period of time by many people, some of whom did not intend
   to contribute to this work.  The editor merely has collected these
   truths, and would like to thank the information technology community
   for originally illuminating these truths.
